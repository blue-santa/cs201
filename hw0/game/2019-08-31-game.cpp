"INSIDE is a game like no other I've ever played.\n\
\n\
At the beginning of the game, you are a young boy, of perhaps 8 years of age, running through a misty forest. Men wearing white masks and with long spindly arms are scattered about, here and there trying to capture and kill you. As the human player moving the character, you assume that this game is a simple escape sequence, with a Platform-style element of gameplay.\n\
\n\
But as the game progresses, it challenges your assumptions. Objects that originally were meant to be used as props by the character instead take control over the character's brain. You have to find ways to control the objects that are now controlling your character.\n\
\n\
You find yourself floating in water, and some dark version of yourself is chasing you, attempting to strangle you.\n\
\n\
You come to a laboratory full of scientists watching a biological experiment growing within a chamber. You become the experiment, and you break out of their laboratory.\n\
\n\
With each change of assumptions, as the human player you struggle to understand both why the game is so utterly fascinating, and at the same time, to understand what kind of game you are actually playing, and what the purpose of the game intends to be.\n\
\n\
When the game finishes, you sit, open-mouthed, wondering if this game is actually complete, or if there is still more gameplay to come. Perhaps, you wondering, the game was never anything more than a prompting to question the game of life that you are already and always playing.\n\
\n\
The game took six years to make, and the total runtime of the game is about 3 hours, if you go slow and enjoy it. I do recommend that you give it a try." << endl;
