"I DIED for beauty, but was scarce\n\
Adjusted in the tomb,\n\
When one who died for truth was lain,\n\
In an adjoining room.\n\
\n\
He questioned softly why I failed?	        5\n\
\"For beauty,\" I replied.\n\
\"And I for truth,â€”the two are one;\n\
We brethren are,\" he said.\n\
\n\
And so, as kinsmen met a night,\n\
We talked between the rooms,	        10\n\
Until the moss had reached our lips,\n\
And covered up our names.\n\
\n\
